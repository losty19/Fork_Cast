# ForkCast

**About ForkCast**
Forkcast is an open-source application designed to help users find meals they enjoy based on their preferences and meal history. A user will be able to choose a recipe from a list of ones they might enjoy, and see all of the ingredients for the dish, and the cooking instructions for it. Our product will enhance a user’s meals by expanding their culinary boundaries.


**How to Start**
Users will navigate to the ForkCast home page and will prompted to sign into their account or create an account. Upon successful login, if user is new to ForkCast, they will see a message prompting them to navigate to the profile page to fill out some of their liked foods, disliked foods, dietary intolerances, and any kind of diet, if the user is following one. After filling out those sections, the user should then return to the main page to submit their first meal request. A meal request will consist of cuisines to include or exclude, if any. After that, they can also input a query to the AI, and press submit. The user will see a list of meals that we think they would possibly enjoy, and they can favorite them to add them to their page. If the user would instead like to add their own meal, they can fill out the “Add Custom Meal” section.
